# KMeans Clustering

This project implements the k-means clustering algorithm. KMeans is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into `k` clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

## Project Structure

- `kmeans.py`: Contains the implementation of the KMeans algorithm and related classes.
- `data_point.py`: Contains the `DataPoint` class used to represent individual data points.
